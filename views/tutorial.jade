        h2 Add a Transcript
        .description
            p On the next page, you will choose a transcript. You have three options:
            ul
                li Use YouTube's autogenerated transcript. This gives you word-level alignment, but no punctuation. It can vary from "pretty good!" to "wildly inaccurate!"
                li Use a transcript that was manually uploaded to YouTube. These can be extremely accurate, but sometimes creators upload captions that are even worse than the autogenerated data.
                li Provide your own SRT or VTT captions file. You can create one automatically with <a href="https://www.descript.com">Descript</a> (see this <a href="a href="https://help.descript.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042211032-Exporting-a-transcript-as-a-document-or-captions-subtitles">how-to</a>), or manually with <a href="https://www.vtt-creator.com/">VTT Creator.</a>
